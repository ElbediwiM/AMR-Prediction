# AMR-Prediction
A machine learning pipeline to predict Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) changes in *E. coli* populations under colistin selection pressure, using genomic data from 68 experimentally evolved bacterial genomes. The workflow links genetic variations (SNPs, indels, gene presence/absence) to phenotypic resistance evolution.
